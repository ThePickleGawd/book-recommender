# Book Recommender

I'm making this website because I don't like Goodreads' UI and I think it'll be a good refresher on web dev (it's been a while). I also want to practice applying some Machine Learning concepts that I've learned recently.

## Credits

I'm using Open Library's API to get all of my book information and images. Thanks!
